# Playlist Generator with Similar Beats
## Into to the Project
This is a automatic playlist recommendation system based on Apache Spark and Apache Kafka \
BPM is among basic measures of checking similar sounding songs. Of course there are other factors as well. You can add, customize and check with other parameters.
## How it works
- First you need to search your song in the Database
- Then in the search results, select the row number of the correct song
- Now you will see limited list of songs that have same BPM
## About Database
This database was taken from Kaggle and it's a song data base from Spotify. Not sure if you will see the database in future, in case the authors have removed it. Either way I have added a CSV version of the DB to play with. \

## Future work
- It's possible to modify this code to evaluate more features.
- Also Integrating neural network will bring more amazing results.
