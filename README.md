# Playlist Generator with Similar Beats
## Into to the Project
This is a automatic playlist recommendation system based on Apache Spark and Apache Kafka \
BPM is among basic measures of checking similar sounding songs. Of course there are other factors as well. You can add, customize and check with other parameters as well.
## How it works
- First you need to search your song in the Database
- Then in the search results, select the row number of the correct song
- Now you will see limited list of songs that have same BPM
## Future work
- It's possible to modify this code to evaluate more features.
- Also Integrating neural network will bring more amazing results.
